### The Clone of Microsofts Official Website

I made Microsoft's Website Clone by using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS and many more technologies. I had somewhat fun and regrets doing this project. I know that I might get like sued by Bill Gates but meh..... Just gave it a try to see if I really am good at frontend development. Showed it to a bunch of "friends" and they said its trash ü•± (Not really). The major Drawback of this repo is that if you check my github profile (pls a follow lol) then you will see that I am a student of a millitary boarding school so I dont have like any time at all. So the matter is that I couldnt make the navbar of mobile responsive (pls no hate i really have no time). But the views of Mobile and Tablet should be there though.
